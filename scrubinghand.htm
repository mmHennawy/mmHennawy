<p>Scrubbing your hands is much more than the routine hand washing we all do 
before examining patients. It is a ritualistic procedure designed to increase 
safety for the patient and for you.</p>
<p>
<a href="../موقع%20أفلام%20طبية/فحص%20و%20كشف/Scrubbing%20you%20Hands_files/scrub13.jpg">
<img src="scrub13.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="312" height="233"></a>Before 
starting your scrub, make sure you are wearing a clean scrubsuit, surgical cap 
and surgical mask. The cap should completely cover your hair. The mask should 
fit securely, particularly over your nose, but not so tight that it impairs your 
breathing. If you should cough or sneeze, the exhaled air should be able to vent 
out the side of your mask. You will also need eye protection against splash of 
body fluids. Some surgical masks include a plastic screen. You may prefer to 
wear surgical goggles. Eyeglass wearers sometimes rely on their eyeglasses to 
protect them. The degree of protection depends on the size and fit of the 
corrective lenses.</p>
<p>Your hands have a lot of bacteria on them, particularly under the nails, 
within the skin oils, and at the bottom of the skin folds. In theory, it 
shouldn't matter how many bacteria are there since you will be wearing sterile 
gloves during surgery. In real life, those gloves often develop holes in them 
over the course of surgery. </p>
<p>The goal is not to eradicate every last bacterium from your skin (not 
possible), but to drastically reduce the number of bacteria on your skin both at 
the beginning of surgery and for its' duration. There are several very 
satisfactory ways to do that:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<a href="../موقع%20أفلام%20طبية/فحص%20و%20كشف/Scrubbing%20you%20Hands_files/scrub15.jpg">
	<img src="scrub15.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="286" height="212"></a>Traditional 
	Scrub: Under running warm water, use a plastic nail file to clean beneath 
	the nails. Wet your hands and forearms up to the elbow. Once you begin 
	scrubbing, keep your hands above your elbows, so the water will drip away 
	from your hands and down to your elbows. Scrub brushes usually have two 
	sides (foam side and bristle side). Use the bristles for the palms of the 
	hands and underneath the nails. Use the foam side for everything else.<br>
	<br>
	Betadine scrub kills lots of bacteria and has long-lasting bactericidal 
	effects. It is an effective scrub solution, but some individuals develop 
	skin sensitivities to it. Other commercial scrub solutions can have similar 
	effects. Plain alcohol kills plenty of bacteria but can damage the skin and 
	has no lasting bactericidal effects once it has evaporated. Hand soap kills 
	many bacteria, is gentler on the skin, but lacks the long-lasting effects of 
	other preparations.<br>
	<br>
	Scrub your hands and forearms, covering the entire skin area. Rinse and 
	repeat, up to several times. Total scrub time should be about 2 minutes. 
	That is long enough to do an effective job, but not so long as to damage the 
	skin. In the olden days, surgeons used to do a 10 minute scrub, but very few 
	do this anymore. The marginal decrease in bacteria counts is offset by skin 
	damage and long-term bacterial colonization of the traumatized skin.<br>
	&nbsp; 
	</li>
	<li>Lotion scrub: Recent commercial scrub developments include a lotion 
	(with emolients, antibacterial chemicals, and alcohol) that are designed to 
	be rubbed into the skin of the hands and forearms. The lotion is rinsed off, 
	and a second application made. After final rinsing, the hands and forearms 
	are as bacteria-free as if a traditional scrub had been used. Advantages 
	include less trauma to the surgical team's skin, and faster preparation (you 
	don't need a full 2 minutes). Drawbacks include cost and contact sensitivity 
	for the skin of some of the team. </li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have scrubbed, step back from the scrub sink and keep your hands 
away from your body and at about chest level. Keep them raised like this while 
you enter the OR (backwards through the door, using your hip to open it. This 
stylized position offers the best protection against you inadvertently 
contaminating your hands, and provides visual cues to those around you that your 
hands are scrubbed and should not be touched. If you accidentally touch 
something, just announce that you are contaminated, leave the OR and re-scrub</p>
