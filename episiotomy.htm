	Injecting anesthesia for a hospital-based episiotomy. In a home birth 
	episiotomy (which is rare), we find this is not necessary since we use the 
	episiotomy as a last resort and the perineal tissue is usually stretched to 
	a very thin maximum already and not requiring anesthesia. Anything given to 
	the mother will cross the placenta and have effect on the baby.

	<p>Various types of incisions. </p>
	<blockquote>
		<li><i>Medio-lateral (posterio-lateral)</i> - Is a favorite of birth 
		practioners and does not require careful control of the baby's head 
		which may damage or tear through the anal sphincter. Often it is used to 
		help with forceps and vacuum extraction types of deliveries. The 
		incision is begun at the center of the fourchette and directed posterio-laterally, 
		usually to the woman's right. It should be not more than 3 cm long and 
		is directed diagonally in a straight line which runs 2-5 cm distant from 
		the anus. If the anus is considered to be 6 on the clock, the incision 
		would be directed to 7 o'clock. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li><i>Median</i> - The incision, begun at the center of the fourchette, 
		is directed posteriorly for approximately 2-5 cm in the midline of the 
		perineum. It is a favored by experienced birth practitioners that have 
		careful control of the baby's head as it passes through the vaginal 
		opening. There is a great risk that the incision will be extended during 
		delivery and can go directly into the anal sphincter resulting in a 
		third degree tear. When vaginal manipulation is necessary or the baby is 
		large, the median incision does not provide as much space as the medio-lateral 
		incision. The advantages are (a)less bleeding, (b)more easily and 
		successfully repaired, (c) greater subsequent comfort for the woman. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li><i>J-Shaped</i> - The incision is begun at the center of the 
		fourchette and directed posteriorly to the mid-line for about 2 cm and 
		then directed outwards toward 7 on the clock to avoid the anus. The 
		suturing of this incision is difficult. Shearing of the tissues occurs. 
		The repaired wound tends to be puckered. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li><i>Lateral</i> - The incision is begun one or more cm distant from 
		the center of the fourchette and is not a favored incision. Bartholin's 
		duct may be severed. The levator ani muscle is weakened. Bleeding is 
		more profuse. Suturing is more difficult and the women experiences 
		subsequent discomfort.

		<p>A mediolateral episiotomy is cut. This is a standard procedure in a 
		hospital birth and is supposed to help facilitate descent of the baby's 
		presenting part (head or buttocks) and the common use of forceps to aid 
		in the delivery of the fetal head. </p>
		<p>Care must be taken to prevent injury to the fetal presenting part. A 
		blunt-ended side of the scissors should be used on the inside of the 
		perineum and the presenting part protected by the practitioner doing the 
		episiotomy. </li>
