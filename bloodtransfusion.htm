			<tr>
				<td vAlign="top" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">In a 
				hospital or hospital-like setting, standard blood banking 
				procedures apply, with the use of carefully cross-matched blood 
				components as needed by the clinical situation.</font> 
				<p><font face="Times New Roman">In some operational settings, 
				standard blood banking procedures may not be applicable or 
				available. In these cases, direct donor to victim transfusion 
				can be life-saving.</font> </p>
				<ul>
					<li><font face="Times New Roman">Try to use a donor with O 
					negative blood (&quot;Universal Donor&quot;) if available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> 
					<ul>
						<li><font face="Times New Roman">Don't try to match, for 
						example, a B+ victim to a B+ donor. While the accuracy 
						of blood type records has improved, there is still a 
						significant inaccuracy rate (as high as 5%) in the 
						medical record laboratory reports, identification cards, 
						and dog tags.&nbsp;</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font face="Times New Roman">If you try to match a 
						B+ victim to a B+ donor (type-specific blood 
						transfusion), you are twice taking a 5% risk of a 
						mismatch. It is safer to take that risk only once.</font><font size="3">&nbsp;</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font size="3">If the only available blood is Rh 
						positive, it can be safely used for transfusing men, as 
						Rh sensitization, should it occur, is usually not a big 
						problem for men.&nbsp;</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font size="3">For women of childbearing age, 80% 
						are Rh positive and they won't have a problem receiving 
						Rh positive blood. Those 20% who are Rh negative may 
						become sensitized to the Rh factor if they receive a 
						unit of Rh positive blood. That may be a reasonable risk 
						if her life is saved as a consequence of the 
						transfusion. However, Rhogam may be used, in very large 
						doses (25-30, full-size, 300 microgram ampoules, IV, per 
						unit of blood), to neutralize the Rh sensitizing effects 
						of the Rh positive blood.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><font face="Times New Roman">Arrange IV tubing so that 
					there is a large-bore needle at each end.&nbsp;</font> 
					<ul>
						<li><font face="Times New Roman">This is facilitated by 
						use of a 3-way stopcock.&nbsp;</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font face="Times New Roman">If this is not 
						available, you can simply cut off the tubing at the end 
						and insert it into the hub of a needle.&nbsp;</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font face="Times New Roman">Sterile petroleum jelly 
						can provide a seal and the needle is held tightly to the 
						IV tubing with adhesive tape.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><font face="Times New Roman">Position the donor about 3 
					feet higher than the victim.&nbsp;</font> 
					<ul>
						<li><font face="Times New Roman">With the victim in a 
						lower bunk, the donor would be in an upper bunk.&nbsp;</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font face="Times New Roman">With the victim on the 
						floor or on the deck, the donor would be on a cot or 
						packing crate.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><font face="Times New Roman">Insert the IV into the 
					donor's vein and let the blood flow downhill through the 
					tube until it reaches the other end. Clamp the tubing just 
					long enough to insert the other end into the victim's IV or 
					vein.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
					<li><font face="Times New Roman">Unclamp the tubing and 
					allow time for about 1 unit (500 cc) of&nbsp; blood to flow into 
					the victim.&nbsp;</font> 
					<ul>
						<li><font face="Times New Roman">The exact amount of 
						time would depend on the caliber of the tubing and 
						needle, length of the tubing, height of the donor above 
						the victim and doubtless other factors.&nbsp;</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font face="Times New Roman">In practice, allow 
						about 10 minutes, but be prepared to stop it earlier if 
						the donor becomes light-headed or dizzy.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><font face="Times New Roman">Because fresh, whole blood 
					has better oxygen-carrying capacity than banked units of 
					packed RBCs, and it is prewarmed, and because it contains 
					platelets, clotting factors and serum proteins, each unit 
					has about twice the clinical impact of a unit of packed 
					cells from the bank. If, based on your clinical experience, 
					you believe a patient would benefit from two units of PRBCs 
					from a blood bank, they will generally do well with a single 
					unit of fresh, whole blood.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
					<li><font face="Times New Roman">After the patient is 
					transferred to a definitive care facility, it will be easier 
					for them to identify the true, native blood type (major and 
					minor&nbsp; blood groups) if they have a sample of blood taken 
					from the patient prior to any transfusions. If time permits 
					and the tactical situation allows for it, try to draw a 
					single red-topped tube of the victim's blood prior to 
					transfusion that you can send along with the MEDEVAC for use 
					by blood banks further up the line.</font> </li>
