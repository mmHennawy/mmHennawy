			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<p>Researchers found the tumor-fighting powers of the drug worked through a 
combination of ways. The drug appeared to inhibit extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, a key component in the molecular pathway that 
leads to the growth of new cells. In addition, the anti-cholesterol medication 
was shown to stop the progression of tumor cells that have already begun to grow 
while also inducing calcium-dependent cell death mechanisms in fibroid tumor 
cells.</p>
<p>&quot;Taken together, this study has identified a novel pathway by which 
simvastatin induces the death of uterine fibroid tumor cells.&quot; said one of the 
authors, Darren Boehning, in a news release.</p>
<p>The anti-tumor properties of simvastatin will continued to be studied by the 
research team, with ongoing investigations focusing on testing the use of the 
drug to treat fibroid in animals, meaning human clinical application isn’t in 
the immediate future.</p>
<p>Still, the authors suggest that if the drug continues to prove its ability to 
fight non-cancerous uterine fibroids, the result could have a lasting impact on 
preventing hysterectomies.</p>

<p class="lead lead-summary" itemprop="articleBody">&nbsp;The antiviral drug 
telbivudine prevents perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), 
according to a study in the June issue of Clinical Gastroenterology and 
Hepatology. “If we are to decrease the global burden of hepatitis B, we need to 
start by addressing mother–to–infant transmission, which is the primary pathway 
of HBV infection,” said study author Yuming Wang from Institute for Infectious 
Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Chongqing, China. “We found that telbivudine not 
only eliminated vertical transmission of HBV from pregnant women to theirs 
infants, but that it is also safe and well tolerated by women and infants.” 
Researchers performed a prospective study of 450 HBV–positive pregnant women 
with high viral load, or significant HBV in the blood, during the second or 
third trimester of pregnancy. Two hundred and seventy nine women received 
telbivudine (600 mg daily) during weeks 24 through 32 of gestation, and 171 
women who were unwilling to take antiviral drugs participated as controls. At 
six months after birth, none of the infants whose mothers were given telbivudine 
tested positive for HBV, compared to 14.7 percent of infants in the control 
group. Levels of HBV also decreased for the moms: almost a quarter who received 
telbivudine had no HBV detectable in their system. Those not on the antiviral 
medication all tested positive for HBV.</p>
<p class="lead lead-summary" itemprop="articleBody">&nbsp;A significantly higher 
proportion of women given telbivudine had undetectable levels of HBV DNA in cord

<h3 class="sectionTitle">Objective</h3>
<p>To investigate factors associated with successful transabdominal sonography-guided 
dilation and curettage for the treatment of cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP).</p>
<h3 class="sectionTitle">Methods</h3>
<p>In a retrospective study, data were reviewed from patients who received 
transabdominal sonography-guided dilation and curettage (TASDC) as the primary 
treatment for early CSP at The Second Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China, between 
2009 and 2013.</p>
<h3 class="sectionTitle">Results</h3>
<p>Among 232 patients, 185 (79.7%) women with CSP were successfully treated with 
TASDC. Among them, 81 (43.8%) required insertion of a Foley catheter into the 
lower uterine segment to stop bleeding. The complication rate was 37.9% (88/232) 
and the failure rate was 21.3% (47/232). Overall, 28 (12.1%), 5 (2.2%), and 4 
(1.7%) patients with massive intraoperative uterine bleeding were treated with 
wedge resection of the uterus, hysterectomy, and uterine artery embolization as 
a secondary treatment, respectively. In binary logistic regression analysis, 
pregnancy of 7&#8197;weeks or less and pregnancy without missed abortion were 
associated with successful TASDC for patients with CSP (<em>P</em>&#8197;&lt;&#8197;0.001).</p>
<h3 class="sectionTitle">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Pregnancy of 7 weeks or less and pregnancy without missed abortion were found 
to be important factors for successful TASDC among patients with CSP. Wedge 
resection was the main secondary treatment to preserve the uterus and remove 
gestational tissue among patients with massive bleeding.</p>

<p>DESIGN Case-control study.</p>
<p>SETTING Academic research center.</p>
<p>PATIENT(S) Patients enrolled at the Hormone and Fertility Center and controls 
at the Department of Urology (LMU-Munich).</p>
<p>INTERVENTION(S) Sperm samples of 11 partners of unexplained RSA cases 
evaluated for elevated diploidy and disomy levels of chromosomes 1-22, X, and Y 
by multicolor sperm fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).</p>
<p>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Aneuploidy rates obtained in RSA-men compared with 
controls from the literature and internally; an increase of the aneuploidy rate 
was considered statistically significant, when it differed &#8805;2 standard 
deviations from the mean baseline level in controls.</p>
<p>RESULT(S) Our sperm FISH data on RSA men showed increased disomy rates for at 
least three chromosomes in more than 60% of patients but no statistically 
significant increase of the overall mean sperm disomy or diploidy rate. In 
particular, meiotic errors involving chromosome 16 contributed to increased 
sperm disomy in more than 60% of our patients.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION(S) These data suggest that among paternal meiotic errors 
nondisjunction of chromosome 16 might have similar relative influence on fetal 
aneuploidy compared with maternal chromosome 16 disomy.</p>

</div>
<p>OBJECTIVE Data regarding the association between isolated single umbilical 
artery (SUA) and pregnancy outcome are inconsistent and mainly address the risk 
of pregnancy complications. Thus, we aimed to focus on the association between 
isolated SUA, and labor and delivery.</p>
<p>METHODS We conducted a case-control study of all singleton pregnancies 
diagnosed with isolated SUA (no known chromosomal/structural anomalies/fetal 
growth restriction) attempting vaginal delivery. Obstetric and neonatal outcome 
was compared with that of a control group of pregnancies with a three-vessel 
cord in a 1:2 ratio matched by parity. Composite adverse outcome included the 
following: Cesarean section (CS) and/or operative delivery due to non-reassuring 
fetal heart rate (NRFHR), prolonged neonatal admission, low Apgar score and 
umbilical artery pH&#8201;&lt;&#8201;7.2.</p>
<p>RESULTS Out of 34&#8201;196 deliveries, 162 (0.5%) were diagnosed with SUA, and 91 
(0.27%) were diagnosed with isolated SUA. Isolated SUA was associated with a 
higher rate of CS due to NRFHR (5.5% vs 1%, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.02), small for gestational age 
(SGA) (14.3% vs 4.9%, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.009), lower birth weight, and a higher rate of 
composite adverse outcome (20.9% vs 8.8%, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.005). On multivariable analysis, 
isolated SUA was independently associated with an increased risk for composite 
adverse outcome (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.05-5.21).</p>
<p>CONCLUSION Isolated SUA is associated with increased risk for CS due to NRFHR 
and increased rate of SGA. © 2014 John Wiley&amp;Sons, Ltd.</p>

	<p align="left">BACKGROUND Vitamin D and iron deficiencies frequently 
	co-exist. It is now appreciated that mechanistic interactions between iron 
	and vitamin D metabolism may underlie these associations.</p>
	<p align="left">OBJECTIVE We examined interrelations between iron and 
	vitamin D status and their regulatory hormones in pregnant adolescents, who 
	are a group at risk of both suboptimal vitamin D and suboptimal iron status.</p>
	<p align="left">DESIGN The trial was a prospective longitudinal study of 158 
	pregnant adolescents (aged &#8804;18 y). Maternal circulating biomarkers of 
	vitamin D and iron were determined at midgestation (&#8764;25 wk) and delivery 
	(&#8764;40 wk). Linear regression was used to assess associations between vitamin 
	D and iron status indicators. Bivariate and multivariate logistic 
	regressions were used to generate the OR of anemia as a function of vitamin 
	D status. A mediation analysis was performed to examine direct and indirect 
	relations between vitamin D status, hemoglobin, and erythropoietin in 
	maternal serum.</p>
	<p align="left">RESULTS Maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was 
	positively associated with maternal hemoglobin at both midgestation and at 
	delivery (P&lt;0.01 for both). After adjustment for age at enrollment and race, 
	the odds of anemia at delivery was 8 times greater in adolescents with 
	delivery 25(OH)D concentrations&lt;50 nmol/L than in those with 25(OH)D 
	concentrations &#8805;50 nmol/L (P&lt;0.001). Maternal 25(OH)D was inversely 
	associated with erythropoietin at both midgestation (P&lt;0.05) and delivery 
	(P&lt;0.001). The significant relation observed between 25(OH)D and hemoglobin 
	could be explained by a direct relation between 25(OH)D and hemoglobin and 
	an indirect relation that was mediated by erythropoietin.</p>
	<p align="left">CONCLUSIONS In this group of pregnant adolescents, 
	suboptimal vitamin D status was associated with increased risk of iron 
	insufficiency and vice versa. These findings emphasize the need for 
	screening for multiple nutrient deficiencies during pregnancy and greater 
	attention to overlapping metabolic pathways when selecting prenatal 
	supplementation regimens.</li>

cancer</font></b><br>
<br>
Oral contraceptive (OC) use reduces a woman’s risk of developing endometrial 
cancer in later life, but by how much and how long does the effect last? A 
Collaborative Group has published data about OC use in over 27 000 women with 
endometrial cancer over the last 20 years (Lancet Onc 2015;16:1061-70).<br>
<br>
The mean age at diagnosis was 63 years and the longer women had used OCs the 
greater the reduction in their risk of uterine malignancy, with every 5 years 
associated with a risk ratio of 0.76 (CI 0.73 – 0.76). The reduction persisted 
for more than 30 years.<br>
<br>
There was significant absolute risk reduction with a woman generally lowering 
her endometrial cancer risk from 2.3 to 1.3 per 100 women years. It is estimated 
since OCs were introduced 5 decades ago, nearly half a million cases of 
endometrial cancer have been prevented by their use. </p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="6" color="#FF0000">12 - Hysteroscopic 
sterilisation</font><font size="5" color="#FF0000"><br>
</font></b>&nbsp;<br>
With the increasing caesarean section rate and improved fetal survival in our 
country –Egypt- the need for permanent contraception is gaining more 
acceptance.&nbsp; The vast majority of procedures are laparoscopic tubal occlusions 
but in the last 10 years the hysteroscopic approach has become more popular in 
western countries, rising from less than 1% of all sterilisations to over 25% 
now.&nbsp; Of these, most are Essure procedures where a coil is inserted into the 
lumen of each fallopian tube via the uterine cavity which causes fibrosis and 
tubal occlusion. Essure is approved in USA 2002(13years ago). This technique 
obviates the need for incisions, abdominal cavity entry and (theoretically) 
general anaesthesia but there is a remarkable lack of data available about its 
acceptability, efficacy and complications and actual cost in Egypt (Dhruva et al 
NEJM 2015 doi:10.1056/NEJMp1510514).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
To fill this information gap, Mao et al (BMJ 2015;373:h5162) reviewed over 8 000 
Essure insertions and outcomes carried out in the New York area over the last 
decade.&nbsp; They found the indications included women who were older, obese, had 
previous abdominal surgery or co-morbidities and half of the procedures were 
performed under general anaesthesia.&nbsp; In keeping with instructions, a 
hysterosalpingogram (HSG) was required 3 months post-insertion to check 
occlusion so there was an opportunity to collect data about side effects.&nbsp; It 
appears that although the long-term results of pregnancy prevention are similar 
to conventional tubal litigation (less than 0.5%) there were 10 times as many 
complications requiring re-operation with Essure.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This extra operative risk (absolute risk about 2%), the unexpectedly high 
anaesthetic rate, the HSG requirement plus the 3 month continuation of 
conventional contraception all add up in terms of cost and efficiency.&nbsp; Essure 
does provide a sterilisation option but at a price and those being offered the 
method need to be told of the real-world complexity rates. Although hysteroscopy 
has become a common procedure in many Egyptian clinics, still many do not have 
the sufficient training. <br>
Prospective data need to be collected and the existing facts communicated and 
the Essure made available at an affordable price.<br>

<br>
</font></b>Ultrasound is used to diagnose whether an early pregnancy is viable 
or not. There are two crucial measurements in deciding if a miscarriage 
diagnosis can be made and they are the mean sac diameter and the crown rump (CR) 
length. If there is an empty gestational sac of greater than 25 mm or a CR 
length of greater than 7 mm with no fetal heart, then the pregnancy is 
non-ongoing.<br>
If the findings are equivocal then the scan should be repeated in 7 days’ time 
and specific criteria are available that offer very high certainty that the 
pregnancy is non-viable if not attained (Preisler et al BMJ 2015;373:h4579). 
These scientists tested the sonographic measurements in nearly 3000 pregnancies 
where the situation was uncertain and found their predetermined criteria to be 
reliable in all the cases they tested.<br>
It is important for all potential parents to be reliably informed about the 
state of their early pregnancies and the data gathered by the study presented 
here give confidence to ultrasonographers that their images reflect the clinical 
situation.</p>

<b>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly 
prescribed class of drugs worldwide and are frequently used by women of 
childbearing age. The adverse gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal 
effects of NSAIDs are well known. Similarly, most clinicians likely understand 
that using NSAIDs in near-term pregnancy may have adverse effects, including 
potential prolongation of labor, premature closure of the fetal ductus 
arteriosus, and increased risk for postpartum bleeding.<sup><a target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> 
However, the potential for NSAIDs to adversely affect ovulation has received 
much less attention, even though this potential complication was described in 
the medical literature over 2 decades ago.<sup><a target="_blank">[2-6]</a></sup>
</b></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">
<b>NSAIDs are prostaglandin inhibitors that block cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 and 
COX-2 enzyme production. The COX enzyme system catalyzes the production of 
biologically important prostaglandins. One isoenzyme, namely COX-2, is active in 
the ovaries during follicular development. Inhibition of COX-2 by NSAIDs and 
COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib) is thought to potentially cause reversible 
luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS) in a subset of patients.<sup><a target="_blank">[1,6]</a></sup> 
This syndrome is characterized by a failure of ovulation. While clinical signs 
of ovulation (eg, elevated body temperature and progesterone levels) do occur, 
follicular rupture and ovum release are absent.</b></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">
<b>COX-2 inhibitors may have further adverse effects on fertility. COX-2 
expression is thought to occur not only in ovulation but also in fertilization, 
implantation, and maintenance of pregnancy.<sup><a target="_blank">[7]</a></sup> 
COX isoforms are important in the generation of prostaglandins that are 
essential for formation of proteolytic enzymes causing rupture of the egg 
follicles as well as prostaglandins crucial in angiogenesis for establishment of 
the placenta.<sup><a target="_blank">[6,7]</a></sup> </b></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">

<b>Prospective, randomized, controlled trials of small sample sizes have

variables, such as menstrual cycle length or overall endocrine profiles of 
cycles in women receiving NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors vs placebo. However, 
unruptured follicles were more often observed in a significantly higher 
proportion of women using these agents, and this effect is reversible upon drug 
discontinuation.</b></p>

</div>
<div class="document-content">
	<h3 align="left">Abstract</h3>
	<p align="left"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br>
	Placenta previa and placenta accreta carry significant maternal and fetal 
	morbidity and mortality. Several techniques have been described in the 
	literature for controlling massive bleeding associated with placenta previa 
	cesarean sections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy 
	and safety of the use of the cervix as a natural tamponade in controlling 
	postpartum hemorrhage caused by placenta previa and placenta previa accreta.<br>
	<strong>METHODS</strong><br>
	This prospective study was conducted on 40 pregnant women admitted to our 
	hospital between June 2012 and November 2014. All participating women had 
	one or more previous cesarean deliveries and were diagnosed with placenta 
	previa and/or placenta previa accreta. <font color="#FF0000">Significant 
	bleeding from the placental bed during cesarean section was managed by 
	inverting the cervix into the uterine cavity and suturing the anterior 
	and/or the posterior cervical lips into the anterior and/or posterior walls 
	of the lower uterine segment</font>.<br>
	<strong>RESULTS</strong><br>
	The technique of cervical inversion described above was successful in 
	stopping the bleeding in 38 out of 40 patients; yielding a success rate of 
	95&nbsp;%. We resorted to hysterectomy in only two cases (5&nbsp;%). The mean 
	intra-operative blood loss was 1572.5&nbsp;mL, and the mean number of blood units 
	transfused was 3.1. The mean time needed to perform the technique was 
	5.4&#8201;±&#8201;0.6&nbsp;min. The complications encountered were as follows: bladder injury 
	in the two patients who underwent hysterectomy and wound infection in one 
	patient. Postoperative fever that responded to antibiotics occurred in 1 
	patient. The mean duration of the postoperative hospital stay was 3.5&nbsp;days<br>
	<strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong><br>
	This technique of using the cervix as a natural tamponade appears to be 
	safe, simple, time-saving and potentially effective method for controlling 
	the severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) caused by placenta previa/placenta 
	previa accreta. This technique deserves to be one of the tools in the hands 
	of obstetricians who face the life-threatening hemorrhage of placenta 
	accreta.</p>

	<h3><span class="node_title"><font size="6" color="#FF0000">18 - Use of 
	Acetaminophen During Pregnancy Linked to Higher Risk for Behaviour Problems 
	in Kids</font></span></h3>
</div>
<p>CHICAGO -- February 24, 2014 -- Children of women who used the pain reliever 
acetaminophen (paracetamol) during pregnancy appear to be at higher risk for 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behavioural problems and 
hyperkinetic disorders (HKDs).</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever during 
pregnancy. But some recent studies have suggested that acetaminophen has effects 
on sex and other hormones, which can in turn affect neurodevelopment and cause 
behavioural dysfunction.</p>
<p>For the current study, Zeyan Liew, University of California Los Angeles, Los 
Angeles, California and colleagues studied 64,322 children and mothers in the 
Danish National Birth Cohort (1996-2002). Parents reported behavioural problems 
on a questionnaire, and HKD diagnoses and ADHD medication prescriptions were 
collected from Danish registries.</p>
<p>More than half of the mothers reported using acetaminophen while pregnant. 
The use of acetaminophen during pregnancy appeared to be associated with a 
higher risk of HKD diagnosis, of using ADHD medications or of having ADHD-like 
behaviours at age 7 years. The risk increased when mothers used acetaminophen in 
more than one trimester during pregnancy.</p>
<p>“Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk 
for HKDs and ADHD-like behaviours in children,” the authors wrote. “Because the 
exposure and outcomes are frequent, these results are of public health relevance 
but further investigations are needed.”</p>

	<h3 class="sectionTitle">Objective</h3>
	<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
	serial stenting vs ureteroscopy for treatment of urolithiasis during 
	pregnancy as a function of gestational age (GA) at diagnosis.</p>
	<h3 class="sectionTitle">Study Design</h3>
	<p>We built decision analytic models for a hypothetical cohort of pregnant 
	women who had received a diagnosis of symptomatic ureteral calculi and 
	compared serial stenting to ureteroscopy. We assumed ureteral stent 
	replacement every 4 weeks during pregnancy, intravenous sedation for stent 
	placement, and spinal anesthetic for ureteroscopy. Outcomes were derived 
	from the literature and included stent infection, migration, spontaneous 
	kidney stone passage, ureteral injury, failed ureteroscopy, postoperative 
	urinary tract infection, sepsis, and anesthetic complications. Four separate 
	analyses were run based on the GA at diagnosis of urolithiasis. Using direct 
	costs and quality-adjusted life years, we reported the incremental costs and 
	effectiveness of each strategy based on GA at kidney stone diagnosis and 
	calculated the net monetary benefit. We performed 1-way and Monte-Carlo 
	sensitivity analyses to assess the strength of the model.</p>
	<h3 class="sectionTitle">Results</h3>
	<p>Ureteroscopy was less costly and more effective for urolithiasis, 
	irrespective of GA at diagnosis. The incremental cost of ureteroscopy 
	increased from –$74,469 to –$7631, and the incremental effectiveness 
	decreased from 0.49 to 0.05 quality-adjusted life years for a kidney stone 
	diagnosed at 12 and 36 weeks of gestation, respectively. The net monetary 
	benefit of ureteroscopy progressively decreased for kidney stones that were 
	diagnosed later in pregnancy. The model was robust to all variables.</p>
	<h3 class="sectionTitle">Conclusion</h3>
	<p>Ureteroscopy is less costly and more effective relative to serial 
	stenting for urolithiasis, regardless of the GA at diagnosis. Ureteroscopy 
	is most beneficial for women who received the diagnosis early during 
	pregnancy.</div>

<p>OBJECTIVES to evaluate the application of a pocket-sized ultrasound machine (PUM) 
in a routine ante-natal third trimester scan compared to high specification 
ultrasound machines (HSUM).</p>
<p>METHODS An observational cohort study on 53 unselected patients, who came for 
their routine third trimester ultrasound scan. First scan was performed by an 
experienced ultra-sonographer (SB) on a HSUM for fetal growth, fetal well-being 
and placental location. A second experienced operator (SG) performed the 
measurements on the PUM. Both operators were blinded for the other one's 
findings and measurements results.</p>
<p>RESULTS Fifty-one patients were eligible and scanned at a median gestational 
age of 31&#8201;weeks +1&#8201;day (range 27w&#8201;+&#8201;2d - 36w&#8201;+&#8201;0d). Mean pre-gestational Body 
Mass Index (BMI) was 22.9&#8201;±&#8201;3.1&#8201;kg/m(2) (range 17.6 - 35.7&#8201;kg/m(2) ). A perfect 
agreement was found for fetal position, fetal bladder and stomach visualization 
(all Kappa 1.0) and very good agreement for placental position (Kappa 0.86). 
Deepest Vertical Pocket (DVP) correlated moderately (ICC 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-0.59; 
Bland-Altman bias -2.43, 95%CI -22.65-27.51). For fetal growth measurements 
there was a very good agreement on BiParietal Diameter (BPD, ICC 0.93, 95% CI 
0.88-0.96; Bland-Altman bias -1.06, 95%CI -5.07-2.95), and a good agreement for 
Femur Length (FL, ICC 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.79; Bland-Altman bias 0.56, 95%CI 
-5.97-7.08) and Trans Cerebellar Diameter (TCD, ICC 0.65, 95%CI 0.46-0.78;

<p>BACKGROUND Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by the combination of 
thrombotic events and/or obstetrical morbidity in patients tested persistently 
positive for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). With good management, around 70% 
of pregnant women with APS will deliver a viable live infant. However, current 
management does not prevent all maternal, foetal and neonatal complications of 
APS.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES This observational, retrospective, single-centre cohort study 
aimed to assess pregnancy outcome in women with aPL treated with 
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in addition to conventional treatment during pregnancy.</p>
<p>STUDY DESIGN One-hundred and seventy pregnancies in 96 women with persistent 
aPL were analysed: 51 pregnancies occurred in 31 women treated with HCQ for at 
least six months prior to pregnancy and continued throughout gestation (group 
A); 119 pregnancies occurred in 65 women with aPL not treated with HCQ were 
included as controls (group B).</p>
<p>RESULTS HCQ-treatment was associated with a higher rate of live births (67% 
group A vs. 57% group B, p=0.05) and a lower prevalence of aPL-related pregnancy 
morbidity (47% group A vs. 63% B, p=0.004). The association of HCQ with a lower 
rate of any complication in pregnancy was confirmed after multivariate analysis 
(OR 2.2; 95%CI 1.2-136; p=0.04). Fetal losses&gt;10(th)weeks of gestation (2% vs. 
11%, p=0.05) and placenta mediated complications (2% vs 11%,p=0.05) were less 
frequent in group A than B. Pregnancy duration was longer in group A than B(27.6 
[6-40] vs. 21.5 [6-40]weeks, p=0.03). There was a higher rate of spontaneous 
vaginal labour in HCQ-treated women compared to group B (37.3% vs. 14.3%,

<p>CONCLUSIONS Despite the heterogeneity in the two groups in terms of SLE 
prevalence and previous pregnancy history, our results support the concept that 
women with aPL may benefit from treatment with HCQ during pregnancy to improve 
pregnancy outcome. The addition of HCQ to conventional treatment is worthy of 
further assessment in a proper designed randomized controlled trial</p>

never–before–seen childbirth technique could help a woman's body heal itself

Baylor's team found that cooling a woman's uterus after a C–section can 
dramatically reduce postpartum blood loss. Led by a team of physicians and 
nurses in labor/delivery from Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas, the 
study explores &quot;uterine cooling,&quot; an experimental method that showed significant 
results in early testing. The theory is based on biological fact: Cold 
temperatures make some smooth muscles contract. The research suggests that the 
uterus is among that group. Women in the control group had standard surgeries, 
which protect the exposed uterus with sponges soaked in a saline solution 
(called the Ecolab® ORS™ Hush Slush System) at 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Women in 
the test group had their uteruses covered with sponges soaked in the same 
solution, but they were cooled to 30 degrees Fahrenheit. The women who underwent 
the cooling technique bled an average of 32 percent less than women in the

	The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of cesarean and any maternal 
	and perinatal effects of a policy induction of labor in uncomplicated 
	full-term singleton gestations. Searches were performed in an electronic 
	database with the use of a combination of text words related to “induction” 
	and “cesarean section” from inception of each database through December 
	2014. We included all randomized controlled trials of uncomplicated 
	singleton gestations at full term (ie, between 39 weeks 0/7 days and 40 
	weeks 6/7 days) with intact membranes randomized to induction of labor or 
	control (ie, expectant management). The primary outcome was the incidence of 
	cesarean delivery. The summary measures were reported as risk ratio (RR) 
	with 95% confidence interval (CI). Five randomized controlled trials, 
	including 844 women, were analyzed. Full-term vertex singleton gestations 
	receiving induction of labor had similar incidence of cesarean delivery 
	compared to controls (9.7% vs 7.5%; RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.75–2.08). Rates of 
	spontaneous (75.9% vs 80.2%; RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.87–1.02) and operative 
	(13.1% vs 10.6%; RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.83–1.81) vaginal delivery were also 
	similar. Induction was associated with similar rates of chorioamnionitis 
	(9.6% vs 8.0%; RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.38–3.39), but statistically significantly 
	less blood loss (mean difference –57.59 mL; 95% CI, –83.96 to –31.21) 
	compared to controls. Regarding neonatal outcomes, induction was associated 
	with a significantly lower rate of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (4.0% vs 
	13.5%; RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18–0.57) and significantly lower mean birthweight 
	(mean difference –135.51 g; 95% CI, –205.24 to –65.77) compared to control 
	group. Induction of labor at full term in uncomplicated singleton gestations 
	is not associated with increased risk of cesarean delivery and has overall

		<h4>BACKGROUND: </h4>
		<p><abstracttext label="BACKGROUND" nlmcategory="BACKGROUND">Analgesic 
		drugs, either opioids or non-opioids, are required and useful for 
		controlling postoperative pain after cesarean section.</abstracttext></p>
		<h4>METHODS: </h4>
		<p><abstracttext label="METHODS" nlmcategory="METHODS">The analgesic and 
		opioid-sparing effects of repeated intramuscular (i.m.) injections of 75 
		mg of diclofenac sodium given immediately after the experiencing of pain 
		following cesarean section under general anesthesia were studied and 
		compared with placebo in a double-blind trial. One hundred twenty 
		patients 18-40 years of age undergoing elective lower segment cesarean 
		section were treated with either 75 mg diclofenac sodium i.m. (60 
		patients) or identical placebo (60 patients), once patients awakened 
		from anesthesia and experienced wound pain. Their initial responses to 
		either treatment during the first hour after administration of 
		medications were studied. The analgesic, sedative, and opioid-sparing 
		effects of the medications were also studied during the next 48 h. Side 
		effects including uterine relaxation and bleeding were compared between 
		patients administered placebo and diclofenac.</abstracttext></p>
		<h4>RESULTS: </h4>
		<p><abstracttext label="RESULTS" nlmcategory="RESULTS">Results showed 
		that 55/60 patients showed significant pain relief within the first 1 h 
		after administration of diclofenac sodium and their mean pain score 
		decreased from 7.09 +/- 1.06 to 0.85 +/- 0.8 (p &lt;0.05). Within the same 
		period, 10/60 patients responded to placebo injections and mean pain 
		score decreased from 6.6 +/- 0.96 to 0.8 +/- 0.78 (p &lt;0.05). During the 
		first postoperative 48 h, 45 patients showed complete pain relief with 
		use of diclofenac alone while 15 patients required 2,800 mg of pethidine 
		in addition to diclofenac treatment. All patients using placebo required 
		pethidine injection; the total amount of pethidine used was 22,700 mg 
		per 48 h. Verbal scores for sedation were lower in patients treated with 
		diclofenac than in patients treated with placebo at 6 and 12 h 
		postoperatively (p &lt;0.05). There were no significant differences in the 
		proportions of patients who required oxytocin infusion due to uterine 
		relaxation in the diclofenac-treated and the placebo-treated groups 
		(7/60 vs. 12/60, p &gt;0.05).</abstracttext></p>
		<h4>CONCLUSIONS: </h4>
		<p><abstracttext label="CONCLUSIONS" nlmcategory="CONCLUSIONS">It might 
		be concluded that repeated i.m. injections of 75 mg diclofenac sodium 
		(maximum two injections per day) could relieve postoperative pain after 
		cesarean section and significantly reduce opioid analgesic requirements 
		without significant effects on uterine relaxation or bleeding during the 
		first postoperative 48 h.</abstracttext></div>

<p>Endometriosis afflicts as many as 15 percent of reproductive-age women in the 
U.S. and millions of women around the world. The disorder can lead to scarring 
of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and other tissues; infertility; inflammation and 
chronic pain.</p>
<p>&quot;The usual treatments for endometriosis are aimed at suppressing estrogen 
production because it's an estrogen-driven disease,&quot; said University of Illinois 
molecular and integrative physiology professor Benita Katzenellenbogen, who led 
the new study with chemistry professor John Katzenellenbogen. &quot;We thought that a 
better approach might be to interfere with both of the main aspects of 
endometriosis: the growth-promoting actions and also the inflammatory aspects -- 
both of which involve the estrogen receptor,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Current pharmaceutical treatments can suppress endometriosis, but often fail 
to reduce the pain and inflammation that are hallmarks of the disorder, said 
John Katzenellenbogen, whose laboratory developed the new compounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Current treatments also have side effects on other tissues through which 
estrogens work, and so they can't be taken forever,&quot; he said. &quot;There also is 
unfortunately a high rate of recurrence of the disease.&quot;</p>
<p>The new compounds, <font color="#FF0000">OBHS (oxabicycloheptene sulfonate)
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">CLI (chloroindazole)</font>, interact with two 
types of estrogen receptors (ER-alpha and ER-beta, respectively). Each drug 
reduced the size of endometriotic tissue or prevented its growth outside the 
uterus in mice. Each also reduced inflammation and suppressed the development of 
new neurons and blood vessels that support the misplaced tissue. The treatments 
did not reduce fertility or the health of young pups born to mouse mothers that 
had undergone the therapies.</p>
<p>The compounds had similar positive effects in human endometriotic cells that 
were grown in culture with human immune cells, called macrophages, which can 
contribute to the inflammation and growth of endometriotic tissue.</p>
<p>The research team also found that adding either of the new compounds to a 
common endometriosis treatment, letrazole, did a better job of suppressing 
endometriosis than letrazole alone.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflammation is a driver of endometriosis,&quot; Benita Katzenellenbogen said. 
&quot;At some point you've got to turn it off, and these compounds turn it off by 
working through the estrogen receptors.&quot;</p>
<p>In a previous study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences, researchers found that CLI suppressed -- and even reversed -- the loss 
of brain neuron structure and function in a mouse model of MS.</p>
<p>While many more years of work must be done to test these new compounds in 
other models and, eventually, in human patients, the work demonstrates a new 
approach to treating endometriosis and other disorders tied to estrogen 
signaling and inflammation, the researchers said.</p>

	Results in Higher Birth Rates Than Clomiphene in Women With PCOS</span></font></h3>
</div>
<p>HERSHEY, Pa -- July 9, 2014 -- The drug letrozole results in higher birth 
rates in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) than the current standard 
treatment, according to a study published in the <i>New England Journal of 
Medicine</i>.</p>
<p>“Clomiphene has its drawbacks,” said lead author Richard Legro, MD, Penn 
State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania. “It’s only 22% successful with 
up to 6 cycles of treatment in producing a successful birth, it has a high 
multiple-pregnancy rate in comparison to unassisted conception, and it has side 
effects including hot flashes and mood changes.”</p>
<p>To compare the 2 drugs, researchers studied 750 infertile women aged 18 to 40 
years with PCOS who wanted to conceive. Women were randomised to either 
clomiphene or letrozole and took the medications for up to 5 cycles, with 
increasing dosage each cycle.</p>
<p>The group of women who received letrozole had a higher rate of live births 
(27.5%) than those on clomiphene (19.1%). In addition, ovulation rates were 
significantly higher with letrozole than with clomiphene at each monthly visit.</p>
<p>Fewer twin pregnancies occurred among the women who took letrozole (3.9%) 
compared with those on clomiphene (6.9%).</p>
<p>Clomiphene was associated with a significantly higher incidence of hot 
flashes and letrozole was associated with a significantly higher incidence of 
fatigue and dizziness.</p>
<p>Birth defects were rare and rates were similar between the 2 medications, 
comparable with those from studies of women who conceive without treatment.</p>
<p>Further research is needed with a larger number of infants to clarify the 
safety of letrozole.</p>

		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p>We sought to describe the incidence of acute pyelonephritis in 
		pregnancy, and to assess its association with perinatal outcomes in an 
		integrated health care system.</p>
		<h3>Study Design</h3>
		<p>A retrospective cohort study was performed using medical records on 
		546,092 singleton pregnancies delivered in all Kaiser Permanente 
		Southern California hospitals from 1993 through 2010. These medical 
		records include the perinatal service system along with inpatient and 
		outpatient encounter files. Adjusted odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
		intervals (CIs) were used to estimate associations.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>The incidence of acute antepartum pyelonephritis was 0.5% 
		(2894/543,430). Women with pyelonephritis in pregnancy were more likely 
		to be black or Hispanic, young, less educated, nulliparous, initiate 
		prenatal care late, and smoke during pregnancy. Pregnancies of women 
		with pyelonephritis compared to those without were more likely to be 
		complicated by anemia (26.3% vs 11.4%; OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.4–2.9), 
		septicemia (1.9% vs 0.03%; OR, 56.5; 95% CI, 41.3–77.4), acute pulmonary 
		insufficiency (0.5% vs 0.04%; OR, 12.5; 95% CI, 7.2–21.6), acute renal 
		dysfunction (0.4% vs 0.03%; OR, 16.5; 95% CI, 8.8–30.7), and spontaneous 
		preterm birth (10.3% vs 7.9%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2–1.5). Most of the 
		preterm births occurred between 33-36 weeks (9.1%).</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>We characterize the incidence of pyelonephritis in an integrated 
		health care system where routine prenatal screening for asymptomatic 
		bacteriuria is employed. Maternal complications are commonly encountered 
		and the risk of preterm birth is higher than the baseline obstetric

		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p>Although a history of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a recognized 
		risk factor for PPH in subsequent pregnancies, little is known about how 
		the risk accumulates over multiple pregnancies, how recurrence varies by 
		PPH subtype, and whether recurrence can be explained by chronic maternal 
		conditions.</p>
		<h3>Study Design</h3>
		<p>Risks of PPH were assessed according to a history of PPH, severity, 
		and subtype (atony, retained placenta, or lacerations) in 538,332 
		primiparous women whose data were included in the Swedish Medical Birth 
		Register from 1997-2009. The role of stable maternal risk factors was 
		evaluated in regression models that predicted probability of recurrent 
		PPH in second and third pregnancy.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Women with a history of PPH had a 3-fold increased risk of PPH in 
		their second pregnancy compared with unaffected women (15.0% vs 5.0%, 
		respectively). Adjustment for stable maternal risk factors did not 
		attenuate this risk significantly (adjusted relative risk, 3.0; 95% 
		confidence interval, 2.9–3.1). In a third pregnancy, the risk of PPH was 
		26.6% after 2 previously affected pregnancies, compared with 4.4% in 
		women with no previous PPH. A history of a specific type of PPH 
		predicted recurrence of PPH in the second pregnancy, not only of the 
		same type but other causes as well.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>PPH risk is highest among women with &gt;1 previously affected delivery 
		and in those with a previous severe PPH. Chronic conditions that are 
		known to be risk factors for PPH do not explain the recurrence risks. 
		The recurrence patterns across PPH subtypes may point to shared 
		pathologic mechanisms underlying the varying PPH causes.</div>

		<h3><span class="node_title"><font color="#FF0000" size="6">85 - Higher 
		Vitamin D Levels in Pregnancy Could Help Babies Become Stronger</font></span></h3>
	</div>
	<p>SOUTHAMPTON, United Kingdom -- January 3, 2014 -- Children are likely to 
	have stronger muscles if their mothers had a higher level of vitamin D in 
	their body during pregnancy, according to a study published in the January 
	2014 edition of the <i>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.</i></p>
	<p>Low vitamin D status has been linked to reduced muscle strength in adults 
	and children, but little is known about how variation in a mother’s status 
	during pregnancy affects her child.</p>
	<p>Low vitamin D concentrations are common among young women in the UK, and 
	although women are recommended to take an additional 10mcg/day of vitamin D 
	in pregnancy, supplementation is often not taken up.</p>
	<p>In the study, vitamin D levels were measured in 678 mothers in the later 
	stages of pregnancy. When the children were aged 4 years, grip strength and 
	muscle mass were measured.</p>
	<p>Results showed that the higher the levels of vitamin D in the mother, the 
	higher the grip strength of the child, with an additional, but less 
	pronounced association between mother’s vitamin D and child’s muscle mass.</p>
	<p>“These associations between maternal vitamin D and offspring muscle 
	strength may well have consequences for later health; muscle strength peaks 
	in young adulthood before declining in older age and low grip strength in 
	adulthood has been associated with poor health outcomes including diabetes, 
	falls and fractures,” said Nicholas Harvey, Medical Research Council 
	Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, United 
	Kingdom.</p>
	<p>“It is likely that the greater muscle strength observed at age 4 years in 
	children born to mothers with higher vitamin D levels will track into 
	adulthood, and so potentially help to reduce the burden of illness 
	associated with loss of muscle mass in old age,” he said.</p>
	<p>The 678 women who took part in the study are part of the Southampton 
	Women’s Survey -- one of the largest and best characterised such studies 
	globally.</p>

		The latest study in JAMA Psychiatry investigated how advanced paternal

		children. After a groundbreaking genetic analysis in 2012 highlighted 
		the surprising number of spontaneous mutations that can occur in the

		to better quantify and describe the risk. While some studies confirmed

		D’Onofrio’s group found that the increased risk for children of fathers 
		older than 45 years soared to 3.5 times compared to that of younger 
		fathers. Children of older fathers also showed a 13 fold higher risk of 
		developing attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a 25 times

		<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="6"><span class="node_title">87 - Common 
		Colds During Pregnancy May Lead to Childhood Asthma</span></font></h3>
	</div>
	<p>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill -- February 3, 2014 -- According to a new study 
	published today, the more common colds and viral infections a woman has 
	during pregnancy, the higher the risk her baby will have asthma.</p>
	<p>The study, published in the February issue of <i>Annals of Allergy, 
	Asthma and Immunology</i>, found a mother’s infections and bacterial 
	exposure during pregnancy affect the in utero environment, thus increasing a 
	baby’s risk of developing allergy and asthma in childhood.</p>
	<p>“In addition, these same children that had early exposure to allergens, 
	such as house dust and pet dander, had increased odds of becoming sensitised 
	by age 5,” said allergist Mitch Grayson, MD, American College of Allergy, 
	Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), Arlington Heights, Illinois. “When dust mites 
	from the mother and child’s mattresses were examined, children with high 
	dust mite exposure yet low bacteria exposure were more likely to be allergic 
	to dust mites than those with low mite exposure and high bacteria contact.”</p>
	<p>Researchers studied 513 pregnant women in Germany, and their 526 
	children. Questionnaires were completed during pregnancy, when the children 
	were 3 and 12 months old, and every year up to 5-years-old. Of the families, 
	61% had a parent with asthma, hay fever or atopic dermatitis.</p>
	<p>According to the ACAAI, asthma and allergy can be hereditary. If both of 
	a child’s parents have allergies, the child has a 75% chance of being 
	allergic. If 1 of the parents is allergic, or if a close relative has 
	allergies, the child has a 30% to 40% chance of having some form of allergy. 
	If neither parent has allergy, the chance is only 10% to 15%.</p>
	<p>“We know that allergy and asthma can develop in the womb since genetics 
	play a factor in both diseases,” said allergist Michael Foggs, MD, ACAAI. 
	“But this study sheds light about how a mother’s environment during 
	pregnancy can begin affecting the child before birth.”</p>
	<p>Asthma is the most common potentially serious medical condition to 
	complicate pregnancy, according to the ACAAI. In fact, asthma affects 
	approximately 8% of women in their childbearing years. When women with 
	asthma become pregnant, 1-third of the patients improve, 1-third worsen and 
	1-third remain unchanged.</p>
