<p><b><font size="6" color="#FF0000">Predicting Menopause With a Blood Test</font></b></p>
<p>Researchers have developed a blood test they say can predict when a woman 
will become menopausal. The blood test measures levels of a hormone called anti-Mullerian 
Hormone (AMH), which is produced by the egg cells in women’s ovaries and is a 
marker for ovarian function. The test may be able to let women as young as 20 
know when they are likely to enter the menopause. Sixty-three women reached 
menopause during the course of the study, and the test was able in most cases to 
predict the age within about four months of the woman’s actual age; the maximum 
margin of error was between three and four years.</p>
<p>Study author Fahimeh Ramezani Tehrani, president of the Reproductive 
Endocrinology Department of the Endocrine Research Centre and associate 
professor of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, Iran, 
reported her findings at the European Society of Human Reproduction and 
Embryology in Rome.</p>
<p>The findings could have implications on how women approach family planning. 
Researchers said it is one of the first population-based studies to provide a 
statistical model for predicting age at menopause.</p>
<p>“We developed a statistical model for estimating the age at menopause from a 
single measurement of AMH concentration in blood samples,” Ramezani Tehrani 
says. “Using this model, we estimated mean average ages at menopause for women 
at different time points in their reproductive life span from varying levels of 
serum AMH concentration. We were able to show that there was a good level of 
agreement between ages at menopause estimated by our model and the actual age at 
menopause for a subgroup of 63 women who reached menopause during the study.”</p>

<p><b>Predicting Menopause With a Blood Test</b> </p>
<p>The study results are based on blood samples from 266 women aged 20 to 49 who 
were part of the larger Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, which began in 1998 and 
continues today. Blood samples were repeatedly collected from the study 
participants every three years, and the researchers also collected data about 
the women’s socioeconomic backgrounds and reproductive histories. The average 
age of beginning menopause was about 52.</p>
<p>Ramezani Tehrani and her team found that:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>AMH levels of 4.1 ng/mL or less predicted early menopause (before age 
	45) in 20-year-olds <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>AMH levels of 3.3 ng/mL predicted early menopause in 25-year-olds <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>AMH levels of 2.4 ng/mL predicted early menopause in 30-year-olds
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Women who had AMH levels of at least 4.5 ng/mL at age 20, 3.8 ngl/mL at age 
25, and 2.9 ng/mL at age 30 could expect menopause to begin after they turned 
50.</p>
<p>“The results from our study could enable us to make a more realistic 
assessment of women's reproductive status many years before they reach 
menopause,” says Ramezani Tehrani. “For example, if a 20-year-old woman has a 
concentration of serum AMH of 2.8 ng/mL, we estimate that she will become 
menopausal between 35-38 years old.”</p>
<p>Ramezani Tehrani says more studies are needed to validate these findings, but 
the blood test could be an important diagnostic tool to evaluate one’s 
reproductive life and could provide a more accurate response than chronological 
age. If these findings are confirmed by larger studies, women may be able to use 
this information when deciding whether or not to delay having a family; those 
predicted to have an early menopause may be best advised to plan earlier rather 
than later and this would be particularly helpful for women with a family 
history of early menopause.</p>

	During Pregnancy May Lead to Childhood Asthma</font></span></h3>
</div>
<p>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill -- February 3, 2014 </p>
<p>&nbsp;According to a new study published today, the more common colds and 
viral infections a woman has during pregnancy, the higher the risk her baby will 
have asthma.</p>
<p>The study, published in the February issue of <i>Annals of Allergy, Asthma 
and Immunology</i>, found a mother’s infections and bacterial exposure during 
pregnancy affect the in utero environment, thus increasing a baby’s risk of 
developing allergy and asthma in childhood.</p>
<p>“In addition, these same children that had early exposure to allergens, such 
as house dust and pet dander, had increased odds of becoming sensitised by age 
5,” said allergist Mitch Grayson, MD, American College of Allergy, Asthma and 
Immunology (ACAAI), Arlington Heights, Illinois. “When dust mites from the 
mother and child’s mattresses were examined, children with high dust mite 
exposure yet low bacteria exposure were more likely to be allergic to dust mites 
than those with low mite exposure and high bacteria contact.”</p>
<p>Researchers studied 513 pregnant women in Germany, and their 526 children. 
Questionnaires were completed during pregnancy, when the children were 3 and 12 
months old, and every year up to 5-years-old. Of the families, 61% had a parent 
with asthma, hay fever or atopic dermatitis.</p>
<p>According to the ACAAI, asthma and allergy can be hereditary. If both of a 
child’s parents have allergies, the child has a 75% chance of being allergic. If 
1 of the parents is allergic, or if a close relative has allergies, the child 
has a 30% to 40% chance of having some form of allergy. If neither parent has 
allergy, the chance is only 10% to 15%.</p>
<p>“We know that allergy and asthma can develop in the womb since genetics play 
a factor in both diseases,” said allergist Michael Foggs, MD, ACAAI. “But this 
study sheds light about how a mother’s environment during pregnancy can begin 
affecting the child before birth.”</p>
<p>Asthma is the most common potentially serious medical condition to complicate 
pregnancy, according to the ACAAI. In fact, asthma affects approximately 8% of 
women in their childbearing years. When women with asthma become pregnant, 
1-third of the patients improve, 1-third worsen and 1-third remain unchanged.</p>
