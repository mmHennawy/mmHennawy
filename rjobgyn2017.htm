	Aggenbach L, et al. – Acute appendicitis during pregnancy can be associated 
	with serious maternal and/or fetal complications, but currently, the optimal 
	clinical approach to the management of pregnant women suspected of having 
	acute appendicitis is subject to debate. The purpose of this retrospective 
	study was to provide recommendations for prospective clinical management of 
	pregnant patients with suspected appendicitis. Researchers concluded that 
	both (perforated) appendicitis and negative appendectomy during pregnancy 
	were associated with a high risk of premature delivery. Further, they 
	concluded that clinical presentation and imaging remain vital in deciding 
	whether surgical intervention is indicated, recommending cautious 
	consideration of the risks of delay until correct diagnosis with associated 
	increased risk of appendiceal perforation and the risk of unnecessary 
	surgical intervention. They recommended that clinicians consider an MRI 
	following an inconclusive or negative abdominal ultrasound, aiming to 
	improve diagnostic accuracy to reduce the rate of negative appendectomies. 
	Finally, they noted that accurate and prompt diagnosis of acute appendicitis 
	can help avoid unnecessary exploration, as can timely surgical intervention 
	in pregnant women suspected of having appendicitis.<p><b>Methods</b> </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Researchers reviewed case records of all pregnant patients suspected

		<li>Researchers histologically verified appendicitis in 15 of 21

<div class="description" itemprop="articleBody">
	UC Berkeley scientists have discovered that chronic stress activates a 
	hormone that reduces fertility long after the stress has ended, and that 
	blocking this hormone returns female reproductive behavior to normal. While 
	the experiments were conducted in rats, the researchers are optimistic that 
	blocking the gene for the hormone – called gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH) 
	– could help women overcome the negative reproductive consequences of 
	stress. “What’s absolutely amazing is that one single gene controls this 
	complex reproductive system, and that you can elegantly knock this gene down 
	and change the reproductive outcome completely,” said Daniela Kaufer, an 
	associate professor of integrative biology. GnIH was discovered only 15 
	years ago, in quail, and found to be a powerful suppressor of fertility. Its 
	mammalian equivalent, RFRP (RFamide–related peptide), was isolated in humans 
	in 2009 by Kaufer’s Berkeley colleague George Bentley, an associate 
	professor of integrative biology. Bentley and Kaufer later found that 
	exposing male rats to stress increased the brain’s production of RFRP. The 
	new study found similar negative effects on fertility in female rats, though 
	the increased levels of RFRP caused by chronic stress last much longer in 
	females than in males. The researchers published their findings in the Jan. 
	13 issue of the journal eLife.</div>

diabetes in their sons,” said Charlotte Verroken, MD, of the Department of 
Endocrinology of Ghent University Hospital in Ghent, Belgium. “We found that in 
a group of healthy men between 25 and 45 years old, sugar handling was related 
to their mother's age at childbirth,” said Verroken. “Specifically, sons of 
mothers under 30 and over 34 years old at childbirth were more insulin resistant

	The support of a romantic partner is often advised for painful medical 
	procedures, but new research from UCL, King’s College London and the 
	University of Hertfordshire finds that this can actually make the pain feel 
	worse. The study, published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective 
	Neuroscience, found that the pain felt by 39 women given ‘pinprick’ laser 
	pulses on their fingers was not reduced by the presence of their partner. In 
	many cases the presence of a partner made the pain feel worse, and increased 
	more for the women who most avoided closeness in their relationships. “We 
	were interested in the role of individuals’ patterns of seeking or avoiding 
	closeness in their relationships,” explains lead author Dr Charlotte Krahé 
	of the King’s College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; 
	Neuroscience, “We wanted to test whether this personality construct, termed 
	attachment style, might determine whether partner support decreases or 
	heightens the experience of pain.” The study found that the more avoidant 
	participants were of closeness in their relationships, the more pain they 
	experienced when their romantic partner was present. This was seen both in 
	the pain ratings that participants recorded and in their brain activity. The

risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer later in life. The Australian 
National University (ANU) study, published in Human Reproduction, found mothers 
who reported smoking most days while pregnant had daughters who had an earlier 
age of first menstruation, or menarche. Lead researcher Dr Alison Behie said 
reaching menarche at an earlier age increases the number of ovulation cycles a 
woman will have in her life, and puts her at greater risk of developing 
reproductive cancers possibly due to increased exposure to hormones such as 
oestrogen. “We’re discovering more and more that major aspects of our biology, 
and even our behaviour, are set before we are born,” said Dr Behie, a biological 
anthropologist from the ANU School of Archaeology and Anthropology. “We know the 
mother’s exposure to stress, such as smoking in this case, can influence the 
long–term health of the child. “Understanding factors that lead to early

<p>Stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability and the third leading 
cause of death in women worldwide. Sex differences in risk factors, treatment 
response and quality of life after stroke complicate stroke management in women. 
Women have an increased lifetime incidence of stroke compared to men, largely 
due to a sharp increase in stroke risk in older postmenopausal women. Women also 
have an increased lifetime prevalence of stroke risk factors, including 
hypertension and atrial fibrillation in postmenopausal women, as well as 
abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome in middle-aged women. Controversy 
continues over the risks of oral contraceptives, hormone therapy and surgical 
intervention for carotid stenosis in women. Pregnancy and the postpartum period 
represent a time of increased risk, presenting challenges to stroke management. 
Recognition of these issues is critical to improving acute care and functional 
recovery after stroke in women.</p>

	<span class="b">BACKGROUND:</span> Several techniques of emergency vaginal

	incompetence (CI), in order to prolong the pregnancy as much as possible and 
	to reduce the adverse maternal-fetal outcomes. The aim of our study was to 
	evaluate the effectiveness of emergency cervical cerclage, performed with 
	the combined modified Shirodkar-McDonald technique.<p><span class="b">
	METHODS:</span> We selected 12 cases of emergency vaginal cerclage, 
	performed between January 1, 2008 and June 30, 2013. The age of the patients 
	was between 20 and 38 years (mean 29.0 ± standard deviation (SD) 5.69), 
	parity between 0 and 2 (mean 0.7 ± SD 0.65), and gestational age at the time 
	of admission ranged between 17 and 26 weeks (mean 21.0 ± SD 3.44). In all 
	these cases, we used a combined modified Shirodkar-McDonald technique to 
	perform the procedure.</p>
	<p><span class="b">RESULTS:</span> The neonatal survival rate was 83.3%. The 
	cesarean section rate was 16.7%. The average pregnancy prolongation was 89.9

	<p><span class="b">CONCLUSIONS:</span> We can assume that the emergency
