				<h2><font size="+3" color="#FF0000">A. Tips 
				for the Exam</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">The needs of individual patients will 
				determine which of these tips are appropriate.</font></p>
				<ul>
					<li><font size="+1">It is generally advisable to defer blood 
					drawing, giving injections, and other potentially disturbing 
					experiences until after completion of the exam.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">If the patient wishes, let her bring 
					someone with her into the exam room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes a relative or 
					care giver will want to come into the exam room with the 
					patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask the patient in a private place what she wants 
					and tell the care giver or relative that your protocol 
					requires you to follow the patient's choice.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Be aware of the potential for sensory 
					overstimulation related to lighting, air currents, the 
					texture and noise of the paper on the exam table, etc. If 
					necessary make adjustments to reduce sensory overload. Some 
					people with disabilities such as autism may readily 
					experience sensory overstimulation.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Provide pleasant sensory experiences 
					such as music, pictures on the ceiling, a pleasant 
					atmosphere, and a comfortable temperature. Sometimes dim 
					lights are soothing, though it is usually better if the 
					patient can be alert and see what is going on.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Go slowly. Talk the patient through the 
					exam. Tell her what you are doing and have her control the 
					speed. Let her know she can ask you to stop.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Use a smaller speculum, a baby-sized 
					speculum, or do a finger exam. Consider doing a &quot;blind&quot; Pap 
					by inserting the swab without a speculum.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Unless contraindicated by medical 
					concerns, do the bimanual exam first. It may be 
					psychologically less traumatic than inserting an instrument.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">If the patient cannot relax her 
					abdominal wall, ask her to press her hand over her pelvic 
					area and then place your hand over hers, although it may be 
					more difficult to feel the uterus this way.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Provide blankets as well as standard 
					drapes to provide more security and privacy.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Allow enough time for the patient to try 
					different positions for comfort.</font> </li>
				</ul>

				<h2><font size="+3" color="#FF0000">B. Tips for the Clinical Breast Exam and 
				Breast Self Exam (BSE)</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Adapt the breast exam to the needs of each 
				patient. For example, if the patient has impaired balance or 
				poor upper body control, you can do a visual inspection of her 
				breasts while she is seated. Work with the patient to increase 
				her ability to do BSE. But if her ability to do BSE remains 
				quite limited, it is best to repeat the clinical breast exam 
				more often than is typically advised for the general female 
				population.</font></p>
				<ul>
					<li><font size="+1">Consider demonstrating parts of the exam 
					on a friend, care giver or health care provider.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">For palpitation, stabilize the patient's 
					arm with pillows or one of your hands, if necessary.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">The clinical breast exam is a wonderful 
					opportunity to educate the patient on BSE.</font> 
					<ul>
						<li><font size="+1">Educational tools, such as breast 
						models with lumps to find, are very helpful.</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font size="+1">Guide the patient's hands through a 
						self-exam.</font> 
						</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">If you have a pamphlet with 
					illustrations of BSE, show it to the patient as you guide 
					her through the steps illustrated in the card.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Be sure your take-home materials match 
					the techniques you are modeling.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">It may be possible for the patient to 
					have a partner or friend help her do BSE at home. It may be 
					helpful to involve this person in the clinic session.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Point out and emphasize parts of the 
					exam the patient will be able to do</font> 
					<ul>
						<li><font size="+1">Observing changes in a mirror</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font size="+1">Noticing how her breasts feel</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font size="+1">Examining the parts of her breasts 
						that she is able to reach</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font size="+1">Examining both breasts with one hand</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font size="+1">Using thumb, palm, or back of hand 
						in examination</font> 
						</li>
						<li><font size="+1">Doing BSE in several shorter 
						sessions</font> </li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Some women will find it easier to start 
					doing BSE in the shower or bathtub, as this is a place they 
					are accustomed to being naked and to touching themselves. 
					The soap can also make it easier to move their hand over the 
					skin.</font> </li>
				</ul>
				<h2><font size="+3" color="#FF0000">C. Equipment and Equipment Modifications</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">High quality accessible equipment is now 
				available. This equipment includes exam tables that can be 
				lowered and offer side, foot, leg and knee support, and 
				mammogram machines that enable women to have a mammogram without 
				standing or leaning. Before purchasing new equipment, though, 
				try to see the pieces in use and talk to both providers and 
				patients who have used them. Equipment such as obstetrical 
				stirrups and high-low exam tables facilitate safer, easier 
				transfers and positioning, but vary in quality and &quot;user 
				friendliness&quot;. Some women with developmental disabilities feel 
				safer in a wide padded table. Side bars that can be raised and 
				lowered can help a woman be and/or feel safer. </font></p>
				<h3><font size="+2">Preparing the Exam Room</font></h3>
				<ul>
					<li><font size="+1">Make sure there is space for a 
					wheelchair to turn or for a sign language interpreter to be 
					visible to the patient. Move or remove furniture if 
					necessary.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Take the paper covering off the exam 
					table if it hinders transfers and positioning</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Using padded and/or strapped stirrups 
					can increase the comfort and safety of the patient</font> 
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2><font size="+3" color="#FF0000">D. Alternative Positions for the Pelvic Exam</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Whenever possible, decisions about 
				positioning should be made by the patient and the practitioner 
				together, depending on each woman's specific needs. Many women 
				cannot comfortably assume the traditional (lithotomy) pelvic 
				exam position. Alternative positions may be easier for women 
				with a wide range of disabilities, including arthritis, multiple 
				sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke and spinal cord injury. The 
				conditions that may indicate the use of an alternative position 
				include, joint stiffness and inflammation, paralysis, lack of 
				muscle control, pain (hip, back, etc.), muscle weakness, 
				spasticity, lack of balance, or muscular contractions.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">In any position it is important that the 
				patient feel safe and well supported and experience the least 
				discomfort possible. If spasticity and lack of muscle control 
				are problems, both she and the practitioner should be confident 
				that she will not fall, be hurt, or hurt someone else.</font></p>
				<h2><font size="+3">The Knee-Chest Position</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">This position does not require the use of 
				stirrups. It is particularly good for a woman who feels most 
				comfortable and balanced lying on her side.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The patient lies on her side with both knees
				</font>
				<img height="292" alt="stirrups speculum exam" src="stirrups_speculum_exam_5.gif" width="224" align="right" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><font size="+1">bent, 
				her top leg brought closer to her chest; or her bottom leg can 
				be straightened while the top leg is still bent close to her 
				chest. The speculum can be inserted with the handle pointed 
				either in the direction of the woman's abdomen or back. Because 
				the woman is lying on her side, the practitioner should be sure 
				to angle the speculum towards the small of the patient's back 
				and not straight up towards her head. Once the speculum has been 
				removed, the woman will need to roll onto her back.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The assistant may provide support for the 
				patient while she is on the exam table, help the woman 
				straighten her bottom leg if necessary, or support the patient 
				in rolling onto her back for the bimanual exam. If the patient 
				cannot spread her legs, the assistant may help her elevate one 
				leg.</font></p>
				<center><hr width="76%" noShade></center>
				<h2><font size="+3">The Diamond-Shaped Position</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">This position does not require the use of 
				stirrups. A woman must be able to lie flat on her back in order 
				to use this position.</font><img height="258" alt="stirrups speculum exam" src="stirrups_speculum_exam_3.gif" width="235" align="right" naturalsizeflag="0"></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The woman lies on her back with her knees 
				bent so that both legs are spread flat and her heels meet at the 
				foot of the table. The speculum must be inserted with the handle 
				up. The bimanual exam can be easily performed from the side or 
				foot of the table.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The assistant may help the patient support 
				herself on the table and hold her feet together in alignment 
				with her spine to maintain this position. A woman may be more 
				comfortable using pillows or an assistant to elevate her thighs 
				and/or use a pillow under the small of the back.</font></p>
				<center><hr width="76%" noShade></center>
				<h2><font size="+3">The V-Shaped Position</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">This position may or may not require 
				stirrups. The patient must be able to lie comfortably on her 
				back to use this position.<img height="230" alt="stirrups speculum exam" src="stirrups_speculum_exam_2.gif" width="290" align="right" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The patient lies on her back with her 
				straightened legs spread out wide to either side of the table. 
				Or she can hold one leg out straight and keep one foot in a 
				stirrup. The speculum must be inserted with the handle up and 
				the bimanual exam can be performed from the side or foot of the 
				table.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">One or two assistants are needed to support 
				each straightened leg at the knee and ankle. The patient may be 
				more comfortable if her legs are slightly elevated or if a 
				pillow is used under the small of her back or tailbone.</font></p>
				<center><hr width="76%" noShade></center>
				<h2>The OB Stirrups Position</h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Obstetrical stirrups provide much more 
				support than the traditionally used stirrups. This position 
				allows a
				<img height="149" alt="stirrups speculum exam" src="stirrups_speculum_exam_7.gif" width="300" align="right" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">woman 
				who has difficulty using the foot stirrups to assume the 
				traditional pelvic exam position.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The woman lies on her back near the foot of 
				the table with her legs supported under the knee by obstetrical 
				stirrups. The speculum can be inserted with the handle down. The 
				bimanual exam can be performed from the foot of the table.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The patient may want assistance in putting 
				her legs into the stirrups. The stirrups can be padded to 
				increase comfort and reduce irritation. A strap can be attached 
				to each stirrup to hold a woman's legs securely in place if the 
				woman prefers this increased support.</font></p>
				<center><hr width="76%" noShade></center>
				<h2><font size="+3">The M-Shaped Position</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">This position does not require the use of 
				stirrups. This position allows the patient to lie with her 
				entire body supported by the table.</font><img height="271" alt="stirrups speculum exam" src="stirrups_speculum_exam_6.gif" width="254" align="right" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The woman lies on her back, knees bent and 
				apart, feet resting on the exam table close to her buttocks. The 
				speculum must be inserted with the handle up. The bimanual exam 
				can be performed from the foot of the table.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">If the woman feels her legs are not 
				completely stable on the exam table, an assistant may support 
				her feet or knees. If a woman has two leg amputations, an 
				assistant may elevate her legs to simulate this position.</font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<center><hr width="76%" noShade></center>
				<h2><font size="+3" color="#FF0000">E. Getting on the Table</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">One of the major benefits of hi-low exam 
				tables is that transfers are simpler and safer for both patient 
				and staff. The protocols of the clinic or medical office often 
				limit what staff are able to do to assist a patient. The patient 
				is the expert in transferring from the wheelchair or in using 
				assistants to climb onto the exam table. The transfer method 
				must be appropriate to the woman's disability, the room space 
				and the exam table. The woman, assistants and 
				practitioner must all thoroughly understand the transfer method 
				they are using before they proceed.</font></p>
				<h2><font size="+3">Pivot Transfer</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Standing in front of the woman, the assistant 
				takes the woman's knees between her/his knees, grasps the woman 
				around the back and under the arms, raises her to a vertical 
				position and then pivots the patient from her wheelchair to the 
				table. The exam table must be low enough for the patient to sit 
				on; therefore, a hydraulic high-low table may be needed when 
				using this transfer method</font></p>
				<h2><font size="+3">Cradle Transfer</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Kneeling beside the woman, the assistant puts 
				one arm under both of the woman's knees and puts the other arm 
				around her back and under her armpits. The assistant stands and 
				carries the woman to the table, or two assistants can grasp each 
				other's arms behind the patient's back and under her knees</font>.</p>
				<h2><font size="+3">Two-Person Transfers</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">In all two-person transfers, the assistants 
				must work together to lift the woman over the arms of her 
				wheelchair from a sitting position onto the exam table. A 
				stronger, taller person should always lift the upper half of the 
				patient's body.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">Method #1 requires the patient to fold her 
				arms across her chest. The assistant standing behind her kneels 
				down, putting her/his elbows under the patient's armpits and 
				grasps the patient's opposite wrists. The second assistant lifts 
				and supports the woman under her knees.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">Method #2 can be used if the patient cannot 
				fold her arms. The assistant standing behind the patient puts 
				her/his hands together if possible so there is less likelihood 
				of losing hold of the patient. The second assistant lifts and 
				supports the woman under her knees.</font></p>
				<h2><font size="+3">Transfer Tips and Equipment</font></h2>
				<ul>
					<li><font size="+1">The patient should direct the transfer 
					and positioning process, if at all possible.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Not all non-ambulatory women need 
					assistance, and some ambulatory women may need assistance. 
					Be aware of individual needs. Don't stereotype.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Assistants should keep their backs 
					straight, bend their knees and lift with their legs.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Assistants should not overestimate their 
					ability to lift. Try a test lift or try lifting the woman 
					just over her wheelchair before attempting a complete 
					transfer.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Assistants who feel that they may drop a 
					patient during a transfer should not panic. Explain to the 
					woman what is happening to reassure her. Assistants will 
					usually have time to lower the patient safely to the floor 
					until they can get additional help.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Some disabled women use a slide board, 
					which forms a bridge from the wheelchair to the exam table 
					for the patient to slide across. In order for this method to 
					work, the table and chair must be approximately the same 
					height. Most exam tables are, however, quite a bit higher 
					than most wheelchairs. High/low exam tables will facilitate 
					the safest and easiest transfer. A wider table can also make 
					transfers and positioning easier even if it is not 
					adjustable in height.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">The patient or an assistant can help by 
					preparing equipment. Women who use wheelchairs should 
					explain how to apply the brakes, detach the footrests and 
					armrests or turn off the motor in the case of an electric 
					wheelchair. If the patient wears adaptive devices such as 
					leg braces or supportive undergarments, she should explain 
					how to remove them if necessary and where to put them.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Women who use urinary equipment should 
					direct assistants in the moving or straightening of catheter 
					tubing. The patient may wish to unstrap her leg bag and 
					place it on the table beside her or across her abdomen for 
					proper drainage. Assistants should be reminded not to pull 
					on the tubing or allow kinks to develop.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Check with the patient to make, sure she 
					is comfortable and balanced after the transfer is completed.</font> 
					</li>
					<li><font size="+1">Watch out for jewelry, clothing, tubing 
					or equipment that might catch or otherwise interfere with 
					the transfer</font> </li>
				</ul>
				<h2><font size="+3" color="#FF0000">F. If Your Patient Is Blind or Visually 
				Impaired</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Prior to the exam, the practitioner can offer 
				the patient the opportunity to examine the speculum, swab or 
				other instruments, which will be used during the exam. Few 
				patients will ask to do this, but most, whether or not they have 
				a disability, want to. If three-dimensional genital models are 
				available, they can be used both to acquaint the </font>woman 
				with her anatomy and to demonstrate the steps of the exam 
				process. During the exam, explain what is ha<img height="278" alt="stirrups speculum exam" src="stirrups_speculum_exam_9.gif" width="285" align="right" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">ppening 
				and about to happen.</p>
				<p><font size="+1">Practitioners or assistants should remember 
				to identify themselves upon entering the exam room and inform 
				the woman if it is necessary for them to leave.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">Ask the patient what kind of orientation and 
				mobility assistance she needs. Clinic or office staff should 
				verbally describe and assist the woman in locating where she 
				should put her clothes; where the various furnishings are 
				positioned; where and how to take a urine</font> <font size="+1">
				sample, if one is needed; how she can approach the exam table; 
				and how to position herself on the table and put her feet in the 
				stirrups. Ask the patient for permission before touching her to 
				guide or maintain contact with her.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">A white cane and guide dog are mobility aids 
				used by many visually impaired people. If a woman is accompanied 
				by a guide dog, do not pet or distract the dog. The dog is 
				trained to respond only to its mistress. A woman may prefer to 
				keep her guide dog or white cane nearby in the exam room. Do not 
				move either of these items without the patient's permission.</font></p>
				<h2><font size="+3" color="#FF0000">G. If Your Patient Is Deaf or Hearing 
				Impaired</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Prior to the exam, your patient may wish to 
				examine the instruments that will be used during the exam. If 
				three-dimensional genital models are available, they can be used 
				to acquaint the patient with her anatomy as well as review the 
				exam process.</font><img height="309" alt="stirrups speculum exam" src="stirrups_speculum_exam_4.gif" width="293" align="right" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The patient should choose which form of 
				communication she wishes to use during her exam: a sign language 
				interpreter, lip reading or writing. Although a patient may use 
				an interpreter throughout most of the patient visit, she may 
				decide not to use the interpreter during the actual exam. Many 
				patients will feel more comfortable with a female interpreter. 
				If an interpreter is used, the patient and the practitioner 
				should decide where the interpreter should stand. The 
				interpreter may stand by the practitioner at the foot of the 
				table or, for more privacy; she may stand nearer the patient at 
				the head of the table. When working with an interpreter, the 
				practitioner should speak directly to the patient at a regular 
				speed instead of to the interpreter. If the patient wishes to 
				lip read, the practitioner should be careful not to move her 
				face out of her sight without first explaining what she is 
				doing. The practitioner should always look directly at the 
				patient and enunciate her words clearly when lip-reading is 
				preferred.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">Ask the patient if she wants to see what is 
				going on. Her head may be elevated so that she can see the 
				practitioner and/or interpreter. The drape that is used to cover 
				the woman's body below her waist can be eliminated or kept 
				between her legs. Some patients may wish to view the exam with a 
				mirror while it is happening.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">If an American Sign Language (ASL) 
				interpreter is needed, this service must be arranged before the 
				day of the exam. See <b>Appendix III</b> for interpreter 
				resources.</font></p>
				<h2><font size="+3" color="#FF0000">H. Other Exam Related Issues</font></h2>
				<h2><font size="+3">Bowel and Bladder Concerns</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Some women with developmental disabilities do 
				not have voluntary bladder or bowel control (e.g., women with 
				severe cerebral palsy). A woman s bladder or bowel routine could 
				affect the pelvic exam.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">A woman's bowel movement routine may require 
				the same type of physical stimulation that she will experience 
				during the speculum, bimanual or rectal exam. A bowel move</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">ment can occur during the pelvic exam. The 
				patient or the patient's care provider should inform the 
				practitioner if this might occur.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">If a woman is catheterized, it is not 
				necessary to remove the catheter, as it will not interfere with 
				the pelvic exam in any way. An indwelling catheter need not be 
				removed during the exam unless it is not working and another 
				catheter is available for insertion. The two types of indwelling 
				catheters are the urethral, which is inserted directly into the 
				woman's urethra, and the suprapubic, which is inserted directly 
				into the bladder through a surgically made opening below her 
				navel. Both allow urine drainage through tubing into a leg bag. 
				The leg bag, usually attached to a woman's leg by a strap, 
				should be empty at the start of the exam so it will not need to 
				be drained later.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">If a woman uses an intermittent 
				catheterization system, she urinates by manually opening her 
				bladder sphincter at regular intervals during the day. Tactile 
				stimulation in her pelvic area during the exam could cause her 
				bladder sphincter to open, with resulting incontinence. The 
				patient may consider scheduling her pelvic exam appointment 
				around her urinary schedule.</font></p>
				<h2><font size="+3">Hypersensitivity</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Before the exam, the patient may want to 
				inform the provider of any hypersensitive areas of her body to 
				help prevent possible discomfort or spasms during the exam. Some 
				women may experience variable responses to ordinary tactile 
				stimulation such as spasms or pain. Others experience 
				generalized discomfort and agitation that makes medical care 
				difficult. Often, sensitive areas can be avoided or an extra 
				amount of lubricating jelly can be used to decrease friction or 
				pressure.</font></p>
				<h2><font size="+3">Spasticity</font></h2>
				<p><font size="+1">Spasms may be a common aspect of a woman's 
				disability. Ranging from slight tremors to quick, violent 
				contractions, spasms may occur during a transfer, while assuming 
				an awkward or uncomfortable position, or from stimulation of the 
				skin with the speculum. If spasm occurs during the pelvic exam, 
				the assistant should gently support the spasming area (usually a 
				leg, arm or abdominal region) to avoid any injury to the 
				patient. Spasms should be allowed to resolve before continuing 
				with the exam.</font></p>
				<p><font size="+1">The intensity and frequency of spasms can be 
				significantly affected by subjective perceptions such as 
				feelings of physical security. A woman who experiences spasms 
				should never be left alone on the exam table where a spasm could 
				pose a serious danger to her. An assistant should stand near the 
				exam table and maintain physical contact with the patient to 
				ensure both safety and a feeling of security.</font></td>
