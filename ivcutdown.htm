								<p>Sometimes, intravenous (IV) access is both 
								important and not available by conventional 
								means. In these cases, an IV cutdown may be 
								useful. </p>
								<p>Three veins are most commonly used for IV 
								cutdowns, the medial and lateral basilic veins 
								in the antecubital fossa, and the X vein over 
								the medial maleolus of the ankle. These veins 
								are favored because:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Their anatomic location is very 
									consistent from one person to the next. 
									</li>
									<li>They are very superficial (just beneath 
									the skin). 
									</li>
									<li>They are large enough to easily identify 
									and accomodate an IV catheter. 
									</li>
									<li>They are in relatively safe locations, 
									surgically. (If the procedure is performed 
									under other than ideal conditions, 
									complications are not likely.) 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Start by placing a tourniquet just above the 
								cutdown site. It should be tight enough to 
								obstruct venous flow back to the heart, but not 
								so tight as to obstruct arterial flow out to the 
								arm or leg.</p>
								<p>Inject local anesthetic just beneath the 
								skin. 1% lidocaine works well for this purpose. 
								Don't use too much volume as it will distort the 
								normal anatomy and make the procedure more 
								difficult.</p>
								<p>Make a 1-inch (in length) incision 
								transversely across the skin overlying the vein. 
								Don't go too deep (beyond the skin) or you may 
								cut the vein.</p>
								<p>Use a curved hemostat to spread the 
								subcutaneous tissues, parallel to the vein. Push 
								in, spread, and release. The idea is to steadily 
								(using 10 or 15 &quot;spreads&quot;) release the vein from 
								the surrounding tissues.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>After the vein is isolated from the 
								surrounding tissues, use the curved hemostat to 
								go underneath the vein. When you are finished, 
								there should be about a half an inch of vein, 
								free of any attachments.</p>
								<p>Slide two ligatures (threads or suture 
								material) underneath the vein. Silk suture works 
								well for this, but plain cotton thread can also 
								be utilized. One of the ligatures is for the 
								proximal (toward the heart) part of the vein; 
								the other is for the distal (away from the 
								heart) part of the vein.</p>
								<p>Tie the distal vein off, but hold onto the 
								tail ends of the ligature to use as traction for 
								the rest of the procedure.</p>
								<p>Lift up (a little) on the proximal ligature. 
								This will elevate the vein and also occlude it 
								so that there won't be any back-bleeding.</p>
								<p>Cut about half-way through the vein. Use a 
								fine scissors or a scalpel for this. This is the 
								delicate part of the procedure, because if you 
								accidentally cut all the way through the vein, 
								you will lose it and won't be able to continue 
								with the IV cutdown at this site.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Normally, when someone cuts 1/2 way 
									through a vein, it will bleed quite a bit. 
									In this case, however, your proximal 
									ligature is kinking the vein upward, 
									preventing blood from flowing backward and 
									out through the incision you just made. 
									Maintain that tension. </li>
								</ul>
								<p>Slip the IV catheter through the opening you 
								just made in the vein, aiming it into the 
								proximal side, toward the heart. When it reaches 
								the kink made by the ligature, you will need to 
								briefly release the tension to allow the 
								catheter to pass.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>It isn't always easy to get the catheter 
									to pass through the opening in the vein. If 
									you encounter difficulty, use sterile 
									scissors or a scalpel to cut off the tip of 
									the cather, at an angle, to give you a 
									pointed tip rather than a flat tip to 
									insert. Pointed tips are easier to pass. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Once the IV catheter is in the vein and 
								advanced as far as you want it to go, tie the 
								proximal ligature around the vein and the 
								catheter, securely fastening the catheter in 
								place. Don't make it so tight, however, that you 
								occlude the catheter.</p>
								<p>Connect IV tubing to the IV catheter and 
								start your infusion. Don't forget to release the 
								tourniquet.</p>
								<p>Suture the skin together with a few 
								interrupted sutures. Then suture the IV catheter 
								to the skin so that it will likely remain in 
								place, even if accidentally tugged on.</p>
								<p>Apply sterile dressings. A</p>
