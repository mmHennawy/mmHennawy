						<p><a name="Suction the Airway"><strong>Suction the 
						Airway</strong></a></p>
						<p>When&nbsp; babies are born, they need to clear the mucous 
						and amniotic fluid from their lungs. Several natural 
						mechanisms help with this: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>As the fetal chest passes through the birth 
							canal it is compressed, squeezing excess fluid out 
							of the lungs prior to the baby taking its' first 
							breath. This is noticed most often after the fetal 
							head is delivered but prior to delivery of the 
							shoulders. After several seconds in this &quot;partly 
							delivered&quot; position, fluid can be seen streaming out 
							of the baby's nose and mouth. 
							</li>
							<li>After birth, babies cough, sputter and sneeze, 
							mobilizing additional fluid that may be in their 
							lungs. 
							</li>
							<li>After birth, babies cry loudly and repeatedly, 
							clearing fluid and opening air sacs in the process. 
							Crying is a reassuring event and does not indicate 
							distress. 
							</li>
							<li>Newborn grunting actions may further mobilize 
							fluid, in addition to opening the air sacs in the 
							lungs. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>While babies will, for the most part, bring the 
						amniotic fluid out of the lungs on their own, they may 
						need some assistance in clearing their airway of the 
						mobilized fluid. This will require suctioning.</p>
						<p>Bulb syringes are commonly used for this purpose, 
						suctioning both the nose and mouth of the baby. If a 
						bulb syringe is not available, any suction type device 
						may be used, including a hypodermic syringe without the 
						needle. </p>
						<p>If no suction device is available, keep the baby in a 
						slight Trendelenburg position (head slightly lower than 
						the feet) and turn the baby to its' side to allow the 
						fluids to drain out by gravity.</p>
						<p><a name="Evaluate the Baby"><strong>Evaluate the Baby</strong></a></p>
						<p>Evaluate the baby for breathing, color and heart 
						rate. If the baby is not breathing well or is depressed, 
						additional drying with a towel may provide enough 
						tactile stimulation to cause the baby to gasp and 
						recover.</p>
						<p>Babies are not slapped on their buttocks for this 
						purpose, although flicking the soles of the feet with a 
						thumb and forefinger can provide enough noxious 
						stimulation.</p>
						<p><a name="Color"><strong>Color</strong></a></p>
						<p>Asses the pinkness of the fetal skin.</p>
						<p>Although some newborn infants are uniformly pink in 
						color, many have some degree of &quot;acrocyanosis.&quot; This 
						means that the central portion (chest) is pink, but the 
						extremities, particularly the hands and feet, are blue 
						or purple.</p>
						<p>Acrocyanosis is normal for a newborn during the first 
						few hours, disappearing over the next day. It is due to 
						relatively sluggish circulation of blood through the 
						peripheral structures, related to immaturity or 
						inexperience of the newborn blood flow regulatory 
						systems.</p>
						<p>Central cyanosis is not normal and indicates the need 
						for treatment. It is due to the accumulation of 
						desaturated (oxygen-depleted) hemoglobin.</p>
						<p>Cyanosis due to airway obstruction is treated by 
						opening the airway.</p>
						<p>Cyanosis due to inadequate ventilations is treated by 
						ventilating the baby.</p>
						<p>In mild cases, cyanosis may be resolved by providing 
						100% oxygen to the baby.</p>
